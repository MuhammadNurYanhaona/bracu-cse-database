# bracu-cse-database

This project is the outcome of our effort to build a rudimentary database system from final project assignments of 
our Advanced Database Systems (CSE 716) course. Every semester, we try to include a new feature in the growing database 
system. The project started in the Fall 2022 semester. Every semester, we pick the best student submissions for 
updating the database system. The chronological changes of our database system is as follows:

1. Fall 2022: the basic feature of saving records to a database file and later retrieving those records from there is
   added to the repository.
